# Airbnb Price Prediction
------------------------------------------
Current Progress:
- Preprocessing: 
   1) Removed listings with invalid names, 
   2) Removed 'id', and 'host_name' columns for ethical considerations, 
   3) Removed observations with NaN values in last_review (date value) since listings with no reviews will have no last_review.

- EDA: [In Progress]
   1) Created a Correlogram of the 14 remaining variables. Identified number of reviews and reviews per month to be highly correlated. No other pair of variables was highly correlated with high correlation defined at $|r_ij| \ge 0.5$. Shown in preprocessing&eda.ipynb
   2) Created a Word cloud from listing names. Shown in preprocessing&eda.ipynb
   3) ...

- Modelling Procedure: [In Progress]
  1) Linear Regression (OLS)
  2) Ridge Regression
  3) Lasso 
      (a) Overview the Lasso model, unique attributes, and optimization process. 
      (b) Show difference from Ridge. (plot beta coeffs as $\lambda -> \inf$ for Lasso and Ridge to show the difference between the two shrinkage methods. (Lasso: Betas reach 0. Ridge: Betas reach ~ 0)
      (c) Run various direct/iterative methods to solve for Lasso coefficients (LU, QR, Cholesky, Gauss-Seidel, SVD, Power), and show derivation.
  4) ... etc.

- Evaluation: (accuracy and time complexity
  - Metric: MSE, run time, generalizability/interpretatbility.
